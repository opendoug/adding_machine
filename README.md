# adding_machine
A simple adding machine with user prompts.

# What does it do?
A few basic functionalities that are covered in this sample:
- Requests user input via input()
- Sets an initial state and allows the user to update the state at the end of a while loop, thereby making it possible to re-run the program if desired
- handles exceptions using try/except/else statements
  - forces the user to input an integer
  - prompts the user if there is an exception
  - updates the state of the while-loop-within-a-while-loop if there are no exceptions, thereby allowing the program to pass into the next phase of the program
